# ICTests
Quick and dirty app for Interval Class training

10 random questions of 4 types:

1. Given a Pitch Class name, input its fixed-c number (eg f# = 6, Bb = 10, c = 0, etc)
2. Given a fixed-c pitch class number, input its name (eg 7 = g, 1 = Db or C#, etc)
3. Given two Pitch Class names (printed to stdout), input their interval class (eg c : d# = 3, c : a = 3, etc)
4. Given a dyad played on the midi device, input their interval class (eg c : d# = 3, c : a = 3, etc)

NB All aural tests will be smaller than an octave and between c4 and b4

Currently, enharmonic pitch class names have been limited to : c, c#, db, d, d#, eb, e, f, f#, gb, g, g#, ab, a, a#, bb and  b.
